Image Processing Project (Academic Purpose)  
A collection of standalone image processing implementations, each developed as a separate assignment for the Image Processing course.  
This repository contains multiple independent Java-based solutions rather than a single integrated application.  
  
Project Structure  
This repository is organized by assignment, with each containing its own self-contained implementation:  
/  
├── assignment_1/                  # 8-bit grayscale image resizing / power law transformation  
│   ├── Main.java                  # Entry point with user interface and workflow control  
│   ├── ImageProcessing.java       # Core image processing algorithms and operations for resize and transformation  
│   ├── ImageDisplay.java          # Visualization utilities  
│   └── ImageFileFinder.java       # File handling utilities for locating images  
│  
├── assignment_2/                  # 8-bit grayscale histogram equalization / local enhancement  
│   ├── Main2.java                 # Entry point for second assignment  
│   ├── ImageProcessing2.java      # Enhanced processing algorithms for histogram equalization / local enhancement  
│   ├── ImageDisplay2.java         # Advanced visualization utilities  
│   └── ImageFileFinder.java       # File handling utilities (reused)  
├── assignment_3/                  # Frequency domain processing   
│   ├── Main3.java                 # Entry point for third assignment   
│   ├── ImageProcessing3.java      # Core algorithms (Fourier, complex[][])   
│   ├── ImageDisplay3.java         # Visualization with comparison   
│   └── ImageFileFinder.java       # File handling with extensions   
│  
└── ... (additional assignments)   # Further assignments following similar structure
