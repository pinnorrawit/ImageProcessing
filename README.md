Image Processing Project (Academic Purpose)
A collection of standalone image processing implementations, each developed as a separate assignment for the Image Processing course. 
This repository contains multiple independent Java-based solutions rather than a single integrated application.

Project Structure
This repository is organized by assignment, with each containing its own self-contained implementation:
/
├── assignment_1/                  # First assignment
│   ├── Main.java                  # Entry point with user interface and workflow control
│   ├── ImageProcessing.java       # Core image processing algorithms and operations
│   ├── ImageDisplay.java          # Visualization utilities (including multi-grid display)
│   ├── ImageFileFinder.java       # File handling utilities for locating images
│
├── assignment_2/                  # Second assignment
│   ├── Main2.java                 # Entry point for second assignment
│   ├── ImageProcessing2.java      # Enhanced processing algorithms
│   ├── ImageDisplay2.java         # Advanced visualization utilities
│   ├── ImageFileFinder.java       # File handling utilities (reused or extended)
